OPEN BUGS
- topic‑init container can’t reach the Kafka broker
- enable local access to SQLite database
- airflow-worker-1 container isn’t starting

NEXT APPROACH
- test: volume mount in both airflow-scheduler and airflow-worker -> volumes: - ./db:/opt/airflow/d -> should create db folder in working directory with sqlite database inside after executing the DAG)

GOOD NEWS
- bot is running and responds accordingly
- Kafka broker and Zookeeper are running
- all other airflow containers including redis and postgres are running
